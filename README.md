# iNfOflag

iNfOflag is an application created to target prominent issue of mininformation and disinformation on social media. One of the most significant causes for this problem is the lack of knowledge of what is true or false information online, whether it be an article, a social media post, or eves from peers. iNfOflag targets this issue by allowing users to scan text that they are unsure about, and lets the users know if there are any flags found in their text, in turn leading them to credible sources to inform them about correct COVID-19 information. It is a desktop app built with QT Environment and C++ 11. 


This app is developed from scratch by Chaya Droznik, under the supervision of Dr. Azhar as an Honor's Project for the course CSC211H Advanced Programming Techniques.

# Inspiration for iNfOflag 

When participating in the BMCC Spring 2022 Idea-thon, I was troubled by the realization that COVID-19 misinformation and disinformation is a prominent cause preventing many people from following the proper precautions to prevent the spread of the deadly virus. I was determined to find a solution to this issue, and decided to create an app that would prevent people who are not informed about COVID-19 from spreading false information that they find online.


# My Solution

I built an application using QT Environment and C++ that will scan the information that it is given to allow the users to know how much of the text is potentially misinforming, and display credible sources of information about the topic to ensure that misinformation is not spread. The credible sources will be taken from places that are highly accredited, to ensure that the correct information is given to the user. The application also gives user the option to see what words were flagged, and to see all their past scans.

# How to use the App
# Download and install QT

First, you have to download QT Framework from their website: https://bit.ly/3osHUr8. Follow the instructions to install version 6.3.

# Changes in the directory

Once QT is download and installed, open the ....

# Challenges

The biggest challenge for me when creating this application was learning how to use QT environment. The syntax is different than C++, and I needed to learn how to integrate the code with QT's language. I was able to overcome this challenge succesfully with the help and guidance of Professor Azhar and the student mentors. Using YouTube also helped me a lot when I was stuck, and I was able to successfully complete the application.

The most essential part of my algorithm is the scanner that is used to check if there are flags in the text. It was a bit challenging to make the scan effective and accurate, but I was able to succesfully build it and that helped me create the rest of the application in a much smoother manner.


# Accomplishments:
Succesfullly incorporated all the major advanced programming techniques that learned in my 211H class.
Learned QT framework and QT API
Learned how to create a big-scale project in a very short time 
Created an application that can not only help solve the prominent issue of COVID-19 misinformation and disinformation, but also can be used to target all other forms of misinformation and disinformation

# Future direction:
I would like to incorporate more options to scan text, including allowing the user to input URLs, to scan text on images, and incorporate a popup button that will allow the users to scan their screen in an other application.

I would also like to make the application more user friendly by creating an app for their phone (incorporating swipe and touchscreen features), a website for desktops, and incorporating pictures and colors that will make the application more welcoming to use.
